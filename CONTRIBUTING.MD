# **Contributing to nba-go**

Welcome to the nba-go community. We would love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it&#39;s:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Reviewing code and manually testing pull requests.
- Becoming a maintainer

Non-Code Contributions:

- Reporting issues, including both feature requests and bug reports.
- Giving feedback if you are evaluating or using nba-go.
- Proposing new features
- Improving our user or developer documentation.

## Community

As it stands the discussion exists primarily within GitHub comments. [PROPOSED CHANGE] Feel free to join our community discord channel. It is a great place to start whether you have a question, are a new contributor, are a new user, or anything else.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
2. If you&#39;ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you&#39;ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

**Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License**

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that&#39;s a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/homerchen19/nba-go/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue;](https://github.com/homerchen19/nba-go/issues/new) it&#39;s that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [This stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that did not work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Make sure to run npm lint for on your code for style unification

## What makes a great nba-go contributor?

Our favorite contributors are those who are actively:

- Posting good questions. This generally means explaining your current understanding, saying what you&#39;ve done or tried so far, and including tracebacks or other error messages if appropriate.
- Learning and practicing Git commit discipline.
- Submitting carefully tested code. This generally means checking your work through a combination of automated tests and manually clicking around the UI trying to find bugs in your work. See things to look for, for additional ideas.
- Posting screenshots or GIFs for frontend changes.
- Being responsive to feedback on pull requests. This means incorporating or responding to all suggested changes and leaving a note if you won&#39;t be able to address things within a few days.
- Being helpful and friendly on the discord server.
